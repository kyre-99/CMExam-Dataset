# CMExam-Dataset
The CMExam dataset contains real exam questions for practicing physicians collected from the Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination (CNMLE). When building the CMExam dataset, the issue of relying on non textual information such as images, tables, and other external information, as well as issues with keywords such as' graph 'and' table ', was excluded. In the end, there were a total of 96161 questions in the dataset, and 68119 questions were retained after deduplication. Among them, there are 65950 Single choice question questions and 2169 multiple choice questions, with a maximum of 5 answers for each question. The dataset is randomly divided into a training set, a development set, and a testing set, with a ratio of 8:1:1.
